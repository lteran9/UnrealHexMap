# Unreal Hex Map
This project houses a basic implementation of a hexagonal grid map. The code is based of this [tutorial](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) which extensively goes over hexagonal grids. 

Moreover, this is just an experimentational project I'm using to learn more about Unreal Engine 5.
